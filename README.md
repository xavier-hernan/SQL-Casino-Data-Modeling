# SQL-Casino-Data-Modeling
In this project, I was tasked with the creation of a database for a casino using SQL. The objective was to provide answers to a set of business questions outlined in the CASINO MODEL.pdf file, which also provided additional information regarding the project and the database itself. To accomplish this, I utilized MySQL Workbench, a graphical interface for creating and administering MySQL databases, resulting in the creation of the EER Casino.mwb file, serving as the database document. Additionally, I employed the utilization of code provided in the CREATE TABLES.pdf and INSERT VALUES.pdf files to establish the necessary tables and insert sample data for testing and answering the business questions outlined in the CASINO MODEL.pdf file. This project presented a challenging experience, as it required a comprehensive understanding of SQL and database management.
